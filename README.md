Digital Signature Project
Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of digital signatures using the cryptography library in Python. The digital signature process involves generating a key for encryption and decryption, creating a signature for a message, and verifying the authenticity of that message.

Features
Key generation for secure communication.
Message encryption and decryption.
Digital signature creation and verification.

Requirements
Python 3.x
cryptography library

You can install the required library using pip:
pip install cryptography

Usage
Import the Required Module

Start by importing the necessary classes from the cryptography library:
from cryptography.fernet import Fernet

Generate a Key
Create a key for encryption and decryption:
key = Fernet.generate_key()
Store the key securely as it is required for both encryption and decryption.

Create a Fernet Instance
Create an instance of the Fernet class with the generated key:
f = Fernet(key)

Encrypt a Message
To create a digital signature, encrypt your message using the Fernet instance:
token = f.encrypt(b"Hi My Name is RUTUJA PATIL")
print("TOKEN: ", token)

Decrypt the Message
You can decrypt the message using the same Fernet instance:
decrypted_data = f.decrypt(token)
print("Decrypted Data: ", decrypted_data.decode())

Conclusion
This project provides a basic implementation of digital signatures using the cryptography library. You can extend this implementation to include additional features such as signing and verifying documents, managing multiple keys, and enhancing security measures.
